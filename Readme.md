# Neuron Research

## About

This project is a framework for simulating coupled neuron firing using the hodgkin huxley model. The initial Neurotransmitter parameters are based on various experimental values. Given different neurotransmitter values and coupling strengths the neural network may synchronize or enter into chaotic firing patterns. The eventual goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of how networks of neurons become chaotic and what chaotic patterns they exihibit.
